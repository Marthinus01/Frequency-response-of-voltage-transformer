# Frequency-response-of-voltage-transformer
My final year project MATLAB program that was used for the measurements
This page consits of the following:
Matlab program used to generate COMTRADE files
Frequency sweep test COMTRADE files of the voltage divider
Different harmonic injected 110 V signals used for CMC and power analyser measurements
And a text file of the code from the Matlab designer app if any complications result from version history or a problem of this sort.
